            <br> Viet Cong was an underground guerrilla fighting group who desired to reunite Vietnam which was divided at the
            17th parallel. South Vietnam and the USA did not want the nation to be reunited with North Vietnam in order to
            prevent the spread of communism. The Viet Cong rose up against the corrupt South Vietnamese government and participated
            in acts of sabotage and assassination. During the Vietnam War, they were one of the major factions that the Americans
            and their allies faced. The Viet Cong were known for their cunning and skill in unconventional warfare.
